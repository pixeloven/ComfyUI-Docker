# Migration Plan (Legacy)

This file previously contained a detailed migration plan for moving from custom bash scripts to ComfyUI’s CLI and lock/snapshot mechanisms.

The project is now using **SPEC-driven development** for design and migration decisions.

The content of this plan has been consolidated and superseded by:

- **docs/specs/custom-nodes-snapshot-spec.md** – current specification for how the Complete image manages and installs bundled custom nodes
- **docs/project-management/custom-nodes-migration.md** – retained high-level research notes and CLI capability summary

Going forward, please use the spec as the source of truth for implementation and design discussions.
