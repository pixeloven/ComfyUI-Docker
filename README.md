## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** 20.10+ and **Docker Compose** 2.x
- **NVIDIA GPU + drivers** (for GPU modes) - [Install Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)
- **8GB+ VRAM** recommended for complete mode
- **20GB+ disk space** for models and images

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pixeloven/ComfyUI-Docker.git
cd ComfyUI-Docker
```

### 2. Launch ComfyUI

**Core Mode** (recommended for most users):
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**Complete Mode** (all features + custom nodes):
```bash
docker compose --profile complete up -d
```

**CPU Mode** (no GPU required):
```bash
docker compose --profile cpu up -d
```

### 3. Access the Interface

Open your browser to: **http://localhost:8188**

### 4. Download Models

Place your Stable Diffusion checkpoints in `./data/models/checkpoints/` or download them through the ComfyUI interface.

## Deployment Profiles

ComfyUI Docker offers three deployment profiles to match your use case:

| Profile | Service | Image | Best For | Features |
|---------|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Core** | `core-cuda` | `ghcr.io/pixeloven/comfyui-docker/core:cuda-latest` | Most users | Essential ComfyUI + GPU acceleration |
| **Complete** | `complete-cuda` | `ghcr.io/pixeloven/comfyui-docker/complete:cuda-latest` | Power users | Custom nodes + SageAttention + pre-installed workflows |
| **CPU** | `core-cpu` | `ghcr.io/pixeloven/comfyui-docker/core:cpu-latest` | Testing/Compatibility | No GPU required |

### Core Mode (`core-cuda`) ‚ö°

Fast, lightweight ComfyUI with GPU support.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- ‚úÖ Essential ComfyUI functionality
- ‚úÖ GPU acceleration (CUDA 12.9)
- ‚úÖ Fast startup
- ‚úÖ Smaller image size

### Complete Mode (`complete-cuda`) üöÄ

Full-featured deployment with custom nodes and optimizations.

```bash
docker compose --profile complete up -d
```
- ‚úÖ Everything core has
- ‚úÖ 13+ pre-installed custom nodes
- ‚úÖ SageAttention optimization (2-3x faster)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Larger image and longer startup

**Included Custom Nodes:**
- ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts, rgthree-comfy, ComfyUI-KJNodes
- ComfyUI-Impact-Pack, ComfyUI-IPAdapter-plus
- ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscale, ComfyUI-IC-Light
- [Full list in scripts documentation](docs/user-guides/scripts.md)

### CPU Mode (`core-cpu`)

No GPU required, universal compatibility.

```bash
docker compose --profile cpu up -d
```

- ‚úÖ Works without NVIDIA GPU
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Slower generation times
- ‚úÖ Lower resource requirements

---

## Data & Storage

ComfyUI Docker uses **individual volume mounts** for each data directory, providing granular control:

```
./data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/          ‚Üí /app/models          (AI models, checkpoints, LoRAs)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ custom_nodes/    ‚Üí /app/custom_nodes    (Extensions and plugins)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input/           ‚Üí /app/input           (Input images/workflows)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output/          ‚Üí /app/output          (Generated outputs)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ temp/            ‚Üí /app/temp            (Temporary files)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user/            ‚Üí /app/user            (User configurations)
```

**Customize paths** via environment variables:
```bash
COMFY_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/models \
COMFY_OUTPUT_PATH=/path/to/outputs \
docker compose up -d
```

See [Data Management Guide](docs/user-guides/data.md) for details.

## FAQ

### What is ComfyUI Docker?

ComfyUI Docker is a production-ready containerization of **[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)**, a powerful node-based interface for Stable Diffusion and other AI image generation models. This project provides:

- **Multiple deployment profiles** (core, complete, CPU-only)
- **Multi-stage Docker builds** using Docker Buildx Bake
- **GPU acceleration** with NVIDIA CUDA support
- **Persistent data management** with granular volume mounting
- **Pre-built images** available on GitHub Container Registry
- **Flexible configuration** via environment variables

Perfect for local development, production deployments, or CI/CD pipelines.

### Which profile should I use?

- **Core Mode**: Best for most users - fast startup, essential features, GPU acceleration
- **Complete Mode**: Best for power users - includes 13+ custom nodes, SageAttention optimization
- **CPU Mode**: Best for testing or when no GPU is available

### Do I need a GPU?

For **Core** and **Complete** modes, yes - an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is required. For **CPU mode**, no GPU is needed, but image generation will be significantly slower.

### Where are my models and outputs stored?

Everything is stored in the `./data/` directory with subdirectories for models, outputs, custom nodes, etc. You can customize these paths using environment variables. See the [Data Management Guide](docs/user-guides/data.md) for details.

### How do I add custom nodes?

**Core mode**: Install custom nodes through the ComfyUI interface or mount them to `./data/custom_nodes/`

**Complete mode**: 13+ custom nodes are pre-installed. See the [Scripts Guide](docs/user-guides/scripts.md) for the full list and how to add more.

### Can I use my own models?

Yes! Place your checkpoints, LoRAs, and other models in the appropriate subdirectories under `./data/models/`. ComfyUI will automatically detect them.

### How do I update ComfyUI?

Pull the latest image:
```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

For local builds, rebuild the images:
```bash
docker buildx bake all --no-cache
```

### Why is my container slow to start?

**Complete mode** performs post-install scripts on first startup. This is normal and only happens once. Subsequent startups will be fast. Consider using **Core mode** if you don't need the extra custom nodes.
